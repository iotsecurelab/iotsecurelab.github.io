			Aniket closely worked with the IoT-Edge Simulator and the three provided IoT setups. His primary
			objective was to analyse and interpret the given examples to serve as a blueprint for
			creating a new setup of our own. He documented the control flows in the code to model our long term aim of 
			simulating a biogas unit using IoT devices.
