			Prakhar Gupta was associated with the lab from Jan 2020 to May 2020, he is currently working in Amazon India, he was involved in making a framework to
                        capture packets and extract features for analysis in an IOT network by setting up Raspberry Pi as the access point. He also made a framework for IOT network visualization.
                        Skills gained (some tools or programming language, max of 10 key words): TShark, Raspberry Pi, Linux Networking, D3JS

			Aniket closely worked with the IoT-Edge Simulator and the three provided IoT setups. His primary
			objective was to analyse and interpret the given examples to serve as a blueprint for
			creating a new setup of our own. He documented the control flows in the code to model our long term aim of 
			simulating a biogas unit using IoT devices.

        		Karthik worked on implementing an authentication protocol based on user, gateway node, and deployed IoT devices. 
			This authentication leverages the use of the smart card, biometrics, and password to establish a session between a user and the 
			specified IoT sensor. He was associated with the lab from Jan 2021 to May 2021, currently he is working in Deloitte USI.

			Ashlin Chirakkal looked at the formal analysis of the WPA2 wifi security protocol. The protocol was first modeled on the AVISPA tool using HLPSL, showing that the tool is not capable of tracing the KRACK attack against WPA2. Then, the tamarin prover software was used to show the WPA2 model and the attack traces against it. Further research is being done to come up with a patch to protect against such types of attacks.
			Skills gained: AVISPA tool using HLPSL, Tamarin Prover tool.

			Sathwika worked on analyzing TinyML’s performance on the Arduino Nano for IOT device
			classification. Her primary task was to use TFLite and Tensorflow to build and train a model for a specific
			dataset and to accurately predict the classes using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. A connection for
			predictive communication between the PC and Arduino was established as well. Various datasets are
			being explored to enhance the scope of her research.

        		Worked on examining TinyML's capabilities for classifying Internet of Things devices on the Arduino Nano. 
			She created and trained a model for a dataset using TFLite and Tensorflow, then used the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to predict the classes reliably.
			The combination of a Python code and an Arduino code allowed for predictive communication using the serial port. 
			She also used the iris dataset for much of my work, although she work with other datasets.
